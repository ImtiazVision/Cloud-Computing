### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery :

Continuous integration and continuous delivery or deployment are abbreviated as CI/CD. It is a way for delivering software programs on a regular and consistent basis.

**Continuous Integration** : When it comes to continuous integration, the developers submit the code to a code repository, which may be anything like GitHub, CodeCommit, or Bitbucket. As soon as the code is submitted, a testing or build server will be created to execute code checks.
