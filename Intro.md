### Cloud Computing :

**Cloud Computing** : is a technology that enables the delivery of services or resources on-demand. We may conceive of cloud computing as renting someone else's equipment on a pay-as-you-go basis for the time being. 

Cloud computing is the evolution of two rapidly growing technologies: 1. Timesharing and 2. Distributed Computing. 

**Time sharing** : enables users to share a large system's processing resources. 

**Distributed computing** : decentralizes computing resources and distributes workload across a network of computers that may be located in the same room or in a completely different place.

### Cloud Characteristics : 

Several of the characteristics of cloud computing include the following :

1. Broad network access
2. **On-demand Self Service** : 
- The customer may choose the resource that is required. 
- The customer can access the resource at any time and from any location.
- Customers can upgrade or reduce their services at any time.
3. **Metered service usage** : 
- No rental
- Pay as you go
- Financial control over business process
4. Elasticity
5. **Provided-pooled computing resources/Resource Pooling** :
- Scale up/down resource based on customers/business
- Achieve multi-tenancy
