### Virtualization : 

**Virtualization** : is the process of creating a virtual environment in a resource to allow the execution of services without interfering with the resource's other operations. It allows us to share a physical instance of a program or resource with numerous users.

### Virtualization Features :
Virtualization's most notable characteristics are:

- **Partitioning** : A resource can be divided to enable several applications and hardware.

- **Isolation** : Each virtual instance is isolated from one another and from the resource.

- **Encapsulation** : A virtual instance can be summarized as a single entity to make it easier to identify the service it provides.

A virtual server is a virtual computer that operates on a server.

The Virtual Machine Monitor (also known as the Hypervisor) oversees the virtual machines that reside on a single host machine.

On top of the hypervisor, the virtual infrastructure management component deals with resource allocation, such as providing information for provisioning virtual infrastructure and assistance for setting operating policies.

VMware vSphere, Citrix, and XenServer are examples of virtualization platforms that operate on physical servers and are used to produce host VMs.

### Benefits of Virtualization : Multitasking and increased efficiency

**Manageability**- the ability to transfer, clone, and isolate virtual machines.
**Sustainability**- energy savings achieved by the use of less hardware and electricity
**Availability**- the ability to backup, clone, and run redundant virtual machines.
**Security**- isolation of virtual machines and applications
