### Virtualization : 

**Virtualization** : is the process of creating a virtual environment in a resource to allow the execution of services without interfering with the resource's other operations. It allows us to share a physical instance of a program or resource with numerous users.

### Virtualization Features :
Virtualization's most notable characteristics are:

- **Partitioning** : A resource can be divided to enable several applications and hardware.

- **Isolation** : Each virtual instance is isolated from one another and from the resource.

- **Encapsulation** : A virtual instance can be summarized as a single entity to make it easier to identify the service it provides.
