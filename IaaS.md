### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 

**Infrastructure as a Service**: is a kind of cloud computing in which virtualized computer services are delivered via the internet. It is when we have a hypervisor and can provision virtual machines using the hypervisor, and Infrastructure as a Service can also be when we rent the physical server itself. However, there are several distinct definitions, but the gist is that it enables us to host an operating system in the cloud that is essentially unique to us. Nobody else has access, so we log in and administer it ourselves. That is, at a high level, what Infrastructure as a Service is. Thus, with Infrastructure as a Service, we only pay for what we use; there is no commitment to a long-term or set contract, and pricing varies according to the model. On Amazon, Linux instances are currently billed on a per-second basis. Windows instances are billed hourly. Google now charges on a per-minute basis, but this may be set to change. Therefore, if we no longer require  a specific service, we can simply turn it off and we will not be invoiced for it.
