## Software Delivery Cycle

Steps illustrating where a project is in its lifecycle. It all begins with the requirements and the necessary planning, after which the software is created, produced, tested, and ready to deploy.


## Test Driven Development

You would effectively be oblivious to the task at hand. You'd create a test to meet the criteria, then double-check the test failure condition. The pass condition will then be tested after a working solution is established. If all goes well, the code will be finished, and you will be given a new assignment.


## Continuous Integration

The project is divided into parks, with each team focusing on a different aspect. Each team will update the master branch several times a day, and when two components don't work together properly, the problem will be found and fixed.


## Continuous Delivery

The team releases software on a regular basis and is steadily improving. You always have something to show potential investors.


## Configuration Management

Configuration management is a method of keeping computer systems, servers, and software in a consistent, desired condition. It's a method of ensuring that a system continues to work as intended while changes are made over time.


## Containerization

A container is a computing environment that is entirely packaged and portable. It's essentially a cloud-based lightweight virtual machine.


## Scalability and Reliability in the Cloud

In cloud computing, scalability refers to the capacity to scale up or down IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. The cloud's scalability is one of its distinguishing features and the key driver of its growing popularity among enterprises.
