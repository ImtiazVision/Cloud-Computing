## Software Delivery Cycle

Steps illustrating where a project is in its lifecycle. It all begins with the requirements and the necessary planning, after which the software is created, produced, tested, and ready to deploy.


## Test Driven Development

You would effectively be oblivious to the task at hand. You'd create a test to meet the criteria, then double-check the test failure condition. The pass condition will then be tested after a working solution is established. If all goes well, the code will be finished, and you will be given a new assignment.
