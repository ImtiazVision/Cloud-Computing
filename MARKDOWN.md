## Software Delivery Cycle

Steps illustrating where a project is in its lifecycle. It all begins with the requirements and the necessary planning, after which the software is created, produced, tested, and ready to deploy.


## Test Driven Development

You would effectively be oblivious to the task at hand. You'd create a test to meet the criteria, then double-check the test failure condition. The pass condition will then be tested after a working solution is established. If all goes well, the code will be finished, and you will be given a new assignment.


## Continuous Integration

The project is divided into parks, with each team focusing on a different aspect. Each team will update the master branch several times a day, and when two components don't work together properly, the problem will be found and fixed.


## Continuous Delivery

The team releases software on a regular basis and is steadily improving. You always have something to show potential investors.


## Configuration Management

Configuration management is a method of keeping computer systems, servers, and software in a consistent, desired condition. It's a method of ensuring that a system continues to work as intended while changes are made over time.
