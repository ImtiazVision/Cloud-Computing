### PaaS

**PaaS** is a term used to describe a platform as a service. It is a cloud-based service that provides a comprehensive development and deployment environment. Platform as a Service is analogous to Elastic Beanstalk. This is where we may not know exactly what resources we need, but we do have our code, and Platform as a Service will go in and supply those resources for us. As a result, Elastic Beanstalk will equip us with elastic load balancers, EC2 instances, and databases, among other things. Thus, Platform as a Service, Azure was quite powerful in the Platform as a Service market until Amazon released Elastic Beanstalk.
