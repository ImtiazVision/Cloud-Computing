### PaaS

**PaaS** is a term used to describe a platform as a service. It is a cloud-based service that provides a comprehensive development and deployment environment. Platform as a Service is analogous to Elastic Beanstalk. We (the client) handle the application and data on the platform, while the service provider manages the runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, storage, and network. And this paradigm allows us to focus on releasing our software to the end user while everything else is taken care of. This is where we may not know exactly what resources we need, but we do have our code, and Platform as a Service will go in and supply those resources for us. Some examples of PaaS inclue Amazons AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google's App Engine and Heroku.
