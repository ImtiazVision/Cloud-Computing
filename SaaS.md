### Software as a Service

Software as a Service is the simplest concept to grasp if we consider something as simple as Gmail.

With Gmail, the only thing we have to worry about is the program itself.
We're concerned about your mailbox, about spam filters, and similar concerns.
We are not concerned with the underlying servers, since Google has taken care of it.

We are not concerned with how they load balance it, how they ensure high availability, or how they read the DNS.

Software as a Service is a model in which we just concentrate on the software itself.
